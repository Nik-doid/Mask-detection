# Real-Time Mask Detection System using YOLOv7  

## üìå Overview  
This project implements a real-time mask detection system using the **YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once)** object detection model. The system detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using a webcam feed. It is designed to help enforce mask-wearing compliance in public spaces, workplaces, or other environments where mask usage is required.  

The model is trained on a custom dataset with two classes:  
- **Mask:** Person wearing a mask.  
- **No Mask:** Person not wearing a mask.  

## üöÄ Features  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Detection**: Detects masks in real-time using a webcam feed.  
‚úÖ **High Accuracy**: Utilizes the **YOLOv7** model, known for its speed and accuracy in object detection.  
‚úÖ **Custom Training**: The model is trained on a custom dataset to ensure optimal performance in specific environments.  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works on both **CPU** and **GPU** (CUDA-enabled devices).  
‚úÖ **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and execution with detailed instructions.  

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Input:** The system captures video frames from a webcam or a pre-recorded video.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Preprocessing:** Each frame is resized to **416x416 pixels** and normalized to match the model's input requirements.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Inference:** The **YOLOv7** model processes the frame and predicts bounding boxes for detected objects (**masks or no masks**).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Postprocessing:** **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** is applied to filter out overlapping boxes and low-confidence detections.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Output:** The system displays the video feed with bounding boxes and labels indicating whether a mask is detected or not.
